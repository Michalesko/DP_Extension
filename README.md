Personalized recommender based on your current browsing goal and browser usage.

EffectiveBrowsing is an automated system which visually filter only the relevant tabs according to the userâ€™s current browsing goal, so you can fully concentrate on the current goal and increase the level of your productivity. The system is based on collaborative filtering, where, for the user in question, other users with most similar aims, preferences and habits are matched; their web sites evaluation is used for the calculation of the relevancy for the user in question. After opening a new tab, the user sees a comparison of time spent by browsing websites belonging to certain categories.

EffectiveBrowsing is also used for parallel browsing mechanisms analysis. We focus on events like creating, activating and closing tabs in one or more windows. We care strongly about privacy, so we don't collect any personal information about the users. All URLs are encrypted before they are sent and stored.

EffectiveBrowsing is being developed as a part of master thesis project at Slovak Technical University in Bratislava, Slovakia.
